# Android Couchbase Lite Todo Demo

Everyone needs a first app when learning a new framework, language, platform or what have you. Todos is the norm, so I made one as well.

This app will let you:

* Create todos
* Mark them as completed
* View all or just incomplete todos
* ~~Change order of todos~~

## Notes

File issues as needed. This is my first Android app but not my first rodeo. I'm likely carrying plenty of baggage from other languages and platforms.
